                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>I have crafted an innovative and powerful task management system, built from the ground up to
                    assist both individuals and teams in streamlining their work processes and enhancing their
                    productivity. This system serves as a robust platform where users can organise, track, and manage
                    their tasks with ease. The system is designed to accommodate the input of tasks, the establishment
                    of dependencies between them, and the assignment of time estimates for each task. This structure
                    offers a highly organised, visual representation of tasks, allowing users to manage their workload
                    effectively. Developed using the versatile C# programming language, the system offers superior
                    performance and reliability.</p>

                <h2>Use of Algorithms and Discrete Structures</h2>
                <p>The backbone of the task management system is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Here, tasks are modeled
                    as nodes and task dependencies as directed edges. To calculate a valid task sequence respecting
                    dependencies, I employ topological sorting. Additionally, the earliest commencement time (ECT) for
                    each task, which depends on the completion of preceding tasks, is determined through this model. The
                    combination of graph theory and advanced algorithms delivers a visually intuitive and
                    high-performing system.</p>

                    <div class="grid-item">
                        <h4>Task Creation and Estimation</h4>
                        <p>Users can create tasks by providing the necessary information: task name, time estimate, and
                            dependencies (if any). The time estimate represents the approximate time it will take to
                            complete the task.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="grid-item">
                        <h4>Task Dependencies</h4>
                        <p>The system allows users to set dependencies between tasks. If Task A depends on Task B, it
                            means Task A cannot start until Task B is completed. Users can set multiple dependencies for
                            a task.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="grid-item">
                        <h4>Task Scheduling</h4>
                        <p>Once tasks and their dependencies have been input, the system calculates a valid sequence for
                            performing the tasks. This sequence ensures that all tasks are performed in an order that
                            respects the set dependencies.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="grid-item">
                        <h4>Earliest Commencement Time</h4>
                        <p>The system calculates the earliest commencement time (ECT) for each task based on its
                            dependencies. The ECT of a task is the earliest time at which the task can begin,
                            considering the completion time of its dependencies.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="grid-item">
                        <h4>Task Report</h4>
                        <p>The system generates a report containing all tasks in their suggested order of execution,
                            along with their ECTs. The report is downloadable in CSV format, which can be opened in any
                            spreadsheet software for further analysis or printing.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="grid-item">
                        <h4>CSV File Support</h4>
                        <p>The task management system allows for importing tasks from a CSV file and exporting tasks to
                            a CSV file. This provides an efficient way for users to bulk input tasks and dependencies,
                            and to save and share their task schedules.</p>
