        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>As a student who is dedicated to learning and developing my skills in Computer Science, I have had the
            opportunity to work both independently and collaboratively on group projects. I have performed well in both
            scenarios, and I understand the importance of contributing to the team effort.</p>
        <p>My goal is to become a software developer, and I believe that my skills and knowledge will enable me to
            achieve this. My desire is to utilise my programming skills to create software that can make a difference in
            people's lives. I want to build applications that can assist businesses in improving their operations, as
            well as individuals in improving their daily lives. The potential for software to drive innovation in
            various industries excites me, and I am eager to contribute to this movement.</p>
        <p>Web application development, in particular, interests me because of the challenges it presents. Creating
            responsive and scalable web applications requires a deep understanding of MVC frameworks, and I have gained
            this understanding through my studies. I am confident in my ability to design clean and efficient code that
            is easy to maintain, but I also understand that there is always more to learn.</p>
        <p>In summary, I am a dedicated and driven student who is determined to become a software developer. I want to
            make a positive impact by using my skills to help others, and I am excited about the potential for software
            to drive innovation.</p>
