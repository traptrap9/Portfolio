                <p>As a student who is dedicated to learning and developing my skills in Computer Science, I have had
                    the opportunity to work both independently and collaboratively on group projects. I have performed
                    well in both scenarios, and I understand the importance of contributing to the team effort. My goal
                    is to become a software developer, and I believe that my skills and knowledge will enable me to
                    achieve this. My desire is to utilise my programming skills to create software that can make a
                    difference in people's lives.</p>
                <p>I am proficient in Python programming language. Knowledgeable in SQL for database management and
                    querying. Experienced in C# programming for building Windows applications. Skilled in web
                    development using MVC frameworks, CSS-Bootstrap, Python-Flask, and jQuery.</p>
