                    <h2>About Me</h2>

                    <h3>Background & Aspirations</h3>
                    <p>
                        As a first-generation Australian raised in a Vietnamese family, resilience, determination, and
                        adaptability have been part of my DNA from a young age. My upbringing instilled in me the grit
                        to face challenges head-on. Applying this tenacity to my pursuit of a Computer Science degree, I
                        have consistently outperformed in my academic endeavors. With a strong foundation in critical
                        thinking and problem-solving, I aim to leverage these skills as a software developer to create
                        impactful, user-friendly applications that streamline processes and improve people's lives.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Technical Proficiencies</h3>
                    <p>
                        My technical skills encompass a wide range of programming languages and tools, including Python,
                        C#, and SQL. I'm particularly skilled in web development, where I've honed my proficiency in MVC
                        frameworks, CSS-Bootstrap, Python-Flask, and jQuery. I thrive in both independent and team
                        settings, consistently contributing innovative solutions to complex problems. I take pride in my
                        capacity to quickly adapt to new technologies and my unyielding commitment to delivering
                        high-quality, efficient, and reliable software solutions.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Extracurriculars & Personal Interests</h3>
                    <p>
                        Beyond the tech world, I am an avid kickboxing and MMA enthusiast. This passion nurtures my
                        competitive spirit, teaches me discipline, and keeps me grounded. It's a pursuit that embodies
                        my belief in lifelong learning and personal growth. On a quieter note, I immerse myself in
                        philosophy and sociology texts, always eager to broaden my perspectives and understand complex
                        societal dynamics. When time allows, I also enjoy shooting hoops, maintaining a balanced
                        lifestyle, and satisfying my wanderlust by exploring diverse cultures and landscapes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This combination of a diverse cultural background, strong technical skills, and multifaceted
                        interests equips me with a unique problem-solving approach. I am excited to bring this distinct
                        perspective and collaborative spirit to a dynamic role in software development.
