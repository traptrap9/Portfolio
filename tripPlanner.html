                <h2>Collaborative Development of an Integrated Commute Planner</h2>
                <h3>A Team Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    Together with four other team members, we embarked on a collaborative project to create a
                    comprehensive map routing web application designed to revolutionise the way users plan their
                    commutes. Our diverse backgrounds and skillsets were harnessed to develop this Java-based
                    application, focusing on creating a personalised and efficient commute planning system for its
                    users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The intent behind our product was not merely to devise a simple route planner, but to provide an
                    integrated commuting solution that accommodates the specific requirements and preferences of
                    individual users. Our goal was to make commuting a more seamless, intuitive, and stress-free
                    experience.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Our application stands out in its ability to help users pinpoint convenient amenities such as bike
                    racks and parking spaces, thus allowing them to optimise their commute paths based on their
                    preferences. For example, a user could plan to drive a portion of their journey, park their vehicle
                    at a specific location, and then bike the remaining distance.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Beyond the daily commute, we designed the application to provide users with valuable insights when
                    considering potential future relocations. By visualising the impact of a new location on their
                    commuting patterns, our users are equipped to make informed, strategic decisions. Our application,
                    thus, recognises the complexities of modern commuting and offers personalised solutions that fit the
                    unique needs of each user.
                </p>

                <h2>Adopting Agile Practises</h2>
                <h3>User Stories, Story Points, MoSCoW, and Documentation</h3>
                <h4>Formulating and Prioritising User Stories</h4>
                <p>By implementing user stories, a technique inherent to Agile methodologies, we represented use cases
                    from the viewpoint of the end-user. This method ensured that our focus always remained on the needs
                    of the user. To gauge the effort required for each user story, we employed story points, allowing us
                    to quantify the complexity of tasks and prioritise them effectively. Furthermore, the MoSCoW method
                    helped us categorise these user stories based on their importance and urgency, streamlining our
                    decision-making process when deciding which features to include in each sprint.</p>

                <h4>Documentation and Team Collaboration</h4>
                <p>To maintain clear communication and alignment within the team, we held weekly meetings where we
                    assessed our progress, addressed challenges, and planned for upcoming tasks. The outcomes and key
                    decisions from these meetings were meticulously documented and stored in our project's GitHub wiki.
                    The practice of thorough documentation was followed throughout the project, where every step from
                    initial planning to final implementation was recorded in detail, serving as a reference guide and a
                    blueprint for future enhancements. Utilising GitHub's wiki feature allowed us to maintain a single,
                    organised, and accessible source of truth for all our project information.</p>

                <p>These practices played a crucial role in facilitating effective project management, enhancing
                    collaboration, and ensuring a user-centric focus in our development process.</p>

                <h2>Backend Architecture</h2>
                <h3>Leveraging Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and OpenTripPlanner in our Map Routing Application</h3>

                <p>Spring Boot, our chosen framework, offered powerful functionality and simplified the setup of our
                    Spring application. Its embedded server eased deployment, and auto-configuration reduced manual
                    setup work. Moreover, dependency management facilitated integration with other tools, like Thymeleaf
                    and OTP.</p>

                <h4>Thymeleaf: Enhancing Development and Debugging</h4>
                <p>Thymeleaf, our server-side Java template engine, allowed for natural templating and direct viewing of
                    templates in browsers, improving our development and debugging processes. Its seamless integration
                    with Spring enabled us to use the Spring Expression Language (SpEL) for dynamic content in our HTML
                    templates.</p>

                <h4>OpenTripPlanner: Powering Multi-modal Trip Planning</h4>
                <p>OpenTripPlanner (OTP), an open-source software, provided extensive functionality for multi-modal trip
                    planning, vital to our application's main feature - personalised commute routes. Its powerful API
                    allowed us to handle complex geographical and transportation data, resulting in optimal route
                    recommendations tailored to user needs.</p>

                <h4>Combining Technologies for a Robust Backend API</h4>
                <p>By integrating these technologies, we created a robust backend API supporting our application's
                    complex functionality and ensuring a streamlined development process. The combination of Spring
                    Boot, Thymeleaf, and OTP helped us maintain good programming practices and offered customisation to
                    meet our project's specific needs.</p>
